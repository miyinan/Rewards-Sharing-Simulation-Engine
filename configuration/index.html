<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>The simulation engine is highly configurable. From the reward scheme parameters to be used to the output files to be generated, there are numerous variables that can vary from execution to execution. This customization is performed using command-line arguments when running the <code>main.py</code> or <code>batch-run.py</code> scripts. We will go through all the available options here, but it's also possible to get an overview of the arguments and their default values by running the corresponding help commands:</p>
<pre><code>python main.py --help
python batch-run.py --help
</code></pre>
<p>Remember though that all arguments are optional, so it is not mandatory to manually set values for any of them.
If not value is explicitly provided, then the corresponding default value is used.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-options">Command-line options</h2>
<p>These are all the arguments that can be configured during execution from the command line:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--n</strong>:</p>
<p>The number of stakeholders / agents in the simulation. The default value is 1000, but any natural numberis accepted. Note that the higher the value of <strong>n</strong> the slower the simulation becomes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--alpha</strong>:</p>
<p>The min effective balance in simulation. In ethereum there is a min effective balance requirment, it is set to be 32 ETH. In our simulation we only look into porpotion, so min_effecive_balance = 1/n*alpha (reward sharing scheme parameter). The default value is 1, but any positive number is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--beta</strong>:</p>
<p>The max effective balance in simulation. In ethereum there is a max effective balance requirment, it is also set to be 32 ETH.  max_effecive_balance = 1/n*beta (reward sharing scheme parameter). The default value is 2, but any positive number is accepted. beta must be bigger than alpha or equal than alpha.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--agent_profile</strong>:</p>
<p>There are two Ethstakeholder profile in our simulation, Easy and Hard.  In Easy, agents can not choose the margin of their pool, and no limitations on opening pools. In hard, agents can choose the margin of their pool.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--cost_min</strong>:</p>
<p>The lowest initial cost that a stakeholder can have (acts as the lower bound of the Uniform distribution that cost values are drawn from). The default value is 10 <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>-5 <code>&lt;/sup&gt;</code>, but any non-negative real number is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--cost_max</strong>:</p>
<p>The highest initial cost that a stakeholder can have (acts as the upper bound of the Uniform
distribution that cost values are drawn from). The default value is 10 <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>-4 <code>&lt;/sup&gt;</code>, but any non-negative real number &gt; <strong>cost_min</strong> is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--extra_pool_cost_fraction</strong>:</p>
<p>When an agent operates one pool, then the cost of the pool is equal to the cost of the agent. However, in our simulation it's possible for agents to operate multiple pools, so we assume that each additional pool an agent operates costs a fraction of their initial cost, and that fraction is the same for all agents and dictated by this argument. The default value is 0.4 (i.e. that a second pool costs 0.4 times as much as the first), but any non-negative real number is accepted (if we assume economies of scale then this value must be &lt; 1, but if we assume some sort of Sybil cost then it can also be &gt;= 1).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--agent_activation_order</strong>:</p>
<p>The order in which agents get activated. The default option is "Semisimultaneous" for activating a number of them simultaneously before moving on.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--relative_utility_threshold</strong>:</p>
<p>The relative utility threshold for accepting new moves (relates to inertia). If an
agent develops a new strategy whose utility does not exceed that of its current one by at least this fraction, then the new strategy is rejected. The default value is 0, i.e. no relative utility threshold exists, but any non-negative real number is accepted. For example, if this threshold is 0.1 then it means that a new move has to yield utility at least 10% higher than that of the current move in order to be selected.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--stake_distr_source</strong>:</p>
<p>The distribution to use for the initial allocation of stake to the agents. The default choice is "Pareto", but other options include "Flat" for a distribution where all agents start with equal stake and "File" where a custom distribution is read from a csv file. In the latter case, the relevant file is expected to be at the root directory of the project, contain only stake values separated by commas and be named synthetic-stake-distribution-X-agents.csv where X is the number of agents used.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--pareto_param</strong>:</p>
<p>The parameter that determines the shape of the Pareto distribution that the stake is sampled from
(only relevant if stake_distr_source is set to "pareto"). The default value is 2 but any positive real number is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--inactive_stake_fraction</strong>:</p>
<p>The fraction of the total stake of the system that remains inactive (is not allocated to any of the agents). The default value is 0, meaning that the active stake of the system is equal to the total stake, but any value between 0 and 1 is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--inactive_stake_fraction_known</strong>:</p>
<p>Flag that determines whether the fraction of the system's stake that is inactive is known upon the launch of the simulation (only relevant when there is inactive stake). If this fraction is known, then the simulation automatically adjusts the target number of pools k. The default setting is for it to remain unknown.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--iterations_after_convergence</strong>:</p>
<p>The minimum consecutive idle iterations that are required before the simulation declares convergence to an equilibrium and terminates. The default value is 10, but any natural number is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--max_iterations</strong>:</p>
<p>The maximum number of iterations that the simulation will perform before terminating. The default is 2000, but any natural number is accepted (it is recommended to keep this number high, in order to give the opportunity for simulations to converge to equilibria).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--metrics</strong>:</p>
<p>A list of ids that correspond to metrics that are tracked during the simulation. Default is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 17, 18, 24, 25]. For the full list of metrics and their corresponding identifiers, see the <a href="../metrics/">Metrics</a> page.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--generate_graphs</strong>:</p>
<p>A flag that determines whether graphs relating to the tracked metrics are generated upon termination of the simulation. By default, this is activated.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--seed</strong>:</p>
<p>The seed to be used by the pseudorandom generator - can be specified to allow for reproducibility of the results. The default value is 'None', which means that a seed is chosen at random (can be accessed through the output of the simulation). Any non-negative integer can be accepted as the seed.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--execution_id</strong>:</p>
<p>An optional identifier for the specific execution of the simulation run, which is used for naming the output folder / files. If no identifier is provided, then one is generated automatically.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--input_from_file</strong>:</p>
<p>A flag that determines whether the input is read from a file (must be named "args.json" and be placed in the root directory of the project). If this is activated, then any other command line arguments are discarded. By default, this flag is not activated.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>--liquidity:</strong></p>
<p>The liquidity factor for calculating liquidity reward. The liquidity reward is porpotional to how many LSD tokens agents hold. In this simulation, are the reward are represent by porpotion, not actual reward. so we assume, if the reward agents get from beacon chain by holding certain amout of ETH is <code>x</code>, then by holding the same amout of LSD, agents can get <code>liquidity*x</code> reward. The default value is 0.1.</p>
